// COMMENT: Why are there parentheses around "(a,b)" in the .sort() method, but not around the "articleObject" or "article" arguments in the .forEach() methods?
// The parentheses specifiy that the function takes in both parameters a and b. With just one variable like article or articleObject, it knows to take that in as a parameter without the parentheses.
rawData.sort((a,b) => {
  return (new Date(b.publishedOn)) - (new Date(a.publishedOn));
